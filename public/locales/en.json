  "investor.section.problem.title": "Problème : un support fragmenté, coûteux et peu mesurable",
  "investor.section.problem.p1": "Dans la plupart des organisations, le support N1 repose encore sur des boîtes mail partagées, des chats non intégrés et des outils généralistes. Résultat : temps de traitement élevé, doublons, forte dépendance à quelques profils clés et expérience utilisateur dégradée.",
  "investor.section.problem.p2": "Parallèlement, les entreprises sont poussées à améliorer l’accessibilité de leurs interfaces (RGAA) et la conformité de leurs process (RGPD), sans disposer d’outils de support conçus dès l’origine pour ces contraintes.",
  "investor.section.solution.title": "Solution : un portail de support piloté par un moteur Nexus",
  "investor.section.solution.p1": "Nexus Support Hub regroupe dans une seule plateforme la gestion des tickets, un moteur d’automatisation intelligente basé sur les technologies Gemini de Google, et des tableaux de bord temps réel pour les managers.",
  "investor.section.solution.p2": "Le moteur Nexus analyse les messages, propose des réponses, structure les tickets (titre, résumé, catégorie, priorité) et prépare le travail des agents N1/N2. L’entreprise garde le contrôle : les cas complexes restent gérés par des humains, le moteur agit comme accélérateur.",
  "investor.section.market.title": "Marché ciblé",
  "investor.section.market.p1": "Nexus vise en priorité les équipes support internes (IT, bureautique, applicatif) des PME et ETI, les ESN / infogéreurs et les éditeurs SaaS qui ont besoin d’un help desk moderne, accessible et industrialisable.",
